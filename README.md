A set of functions that add on to [Jasmine][] and make
it look more like RSpec.

This plugin is written in [Coffeescript][], and looks
and feels best when the tests are written in coffeescript
as well. That being said, there's nothing to stop you
from using it for your javascript testing.

# Installation

Add src/jasmine-rspec.js to your jasmine helpers in
spec/javascripts/support/jasmine.yml:

    helpers:
      - helpers/**/*.js

# Examples

See the examples in examples/*.coffee for more detail, but here's a taste:

    class BankAccount
      constructor: ->
        @balance = 0
      deposit: (amount) ->
        @balance += amount
      is_in_the_red: ->
        @balance < 0
    
    describe 'BankAccount', ->
    
      subject -> new BankAccount()
    
      shared_examples_for 'a store of money', ->
        it -> @should respond_to('deposit')
    
      context 'initially', ->
        it_should_behave_like 'a store of money', ->
          its 'balance', -> @should equal(0)
    
      let_ 'paycheck', -> 5
    
      when_ 'depositing moneys', ->
        subject.deposit paycheck
    
      then_ ->
        the 'paycheck', -> @should equal(subject.balance)
        its 'balance', -> @should equal(paycheck)
        it -> @should_not be('in_the_red')
    
        when_ 'i get payed some more', ->
          subject.deposit paycheck
          subject.deposit paycheck
    
        then_ ->
          its 'balance', -> @should be_divisible_by(paycheck)
